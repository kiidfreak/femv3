## **2. Adding Actions (Points & Goals)**
Inside the Campaign page, look for the **"Campaign Actions"** section. These are the tasks a business must do to earn points.

In the **"Rewards"** section, define what a business gets for their hard work.

## **4. Tracking & Moderation**
*   **Business Progress**: View **"Business campaign progresss"** to see who is winning.
*   **Verified by Admin**: Some actions require a Church Admin to "Verify" them. Go to **"Completed actions"** to approve manual tasks.

## **🛠️ Troubleshooting & Support**
*   **"Campaign not visible"**: Check if the status is **Active** and the current date is within the **Start/End** range.
*   **"Points not updating"**: The system recalculates points automatically whenever you add or edit an Action.

*Happy Campaigning!* ⚓
